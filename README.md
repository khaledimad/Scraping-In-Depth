# Scraping-In-Depth
In this Repository, we take scraping to a whole new level by tapping into APIs and later web-scraping eBay to extract useful information to make meaningful insights.


This project is divided into two parts:
In the first, we will be trying out scraping using APIs.

The second and more intricate part will be an in-depth scrape into e-bay's playstation 4 search pages in order to later using basic statistical analysis to examine which sellers advertise and sponsor on eBay.
